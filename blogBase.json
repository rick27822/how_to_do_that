As a beginner, I have to admit that my coding skills aren\u2019t great yet. It\u2019s not just coding\u2014other courses sometimes make me feel nervous too.\n\nTo improve in all my classes, I\u2019ve been following my teachers\u2019 advice, and I\u2019ve decided to update this blog as often as possible. The content will be varied: mostly my study notes, and maybe some of my projects in the future.\n\nI hope this blog helps me grow, and that it can last a long time. \u3002", "top": 0, "createdAt": 1761567057, "style": "", "script": "", "head": "", "ogImage": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/218213945?v=4", "createdDate": "2025-10-27", "dateLabelColor": "#0969da"}}, "singeListJson": {}, "labelColorDict": {"bug": "#d73a4a", "documentation": "#0075ca", "duplicate": "#cfd3d7", "enhancement": "#a2eeef", "good first issue": "#7057ff", "help wanted": "#008672", "invalid": "#e4e669", "question": "#d876e3", "wontfix": "#ffffff"}, "displayTitle": "RICK'S BLOG", "faviconUrl": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/218213945?v=4", "ogImage": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/218213945?v=4", "primerCSS": "<link href='https://mirrors.sustech.edu.cn/cdnjs/ajax/libs/Primer/21.0.7/primer.css' rel='stylesheet' />", "homeUrl": "https://rick27822.github.io/how_to_do_that", "prevUrl": "disabled", "nextUrl": "disabled"}
