My First Blog: How It All Began

I’m an undergraduate student at NKU, majoring in computer science. As a beginner, I have to admit that my coding skills aren’t great yet. It’s not just coding—other courses sometimes make me feel nervous too.

To improve in all my classes, I’ve been following my teachers’ advice, and I’ve decided to update this blog as often as possible. The content will be varied: mostly my study notes, and maybe some of my projects in the future.

I hope this blog helps me grow, and that it can last a long time.
